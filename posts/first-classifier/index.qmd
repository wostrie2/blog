Following the code from [Is it a bird? Creating a model from your own data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data), I trained a classifer: [Is it a lizard?](https://www.kaggle.com/billostrie2/v2-is-it-a-lizard).

I don't know what all the code means yet, but it turns out that it is surprisingly easy to train a deep learning model for a task like this.

I did learn the value of looking at the data at each step - when searching for "rock photos" I ended up with photos of Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson in my data :)
