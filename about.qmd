Hi, my name is Bill! I live in north San Diego County, California, USA. I'm currently working in software testing, and I coach fencing a couple of nights a week at a local club.

I'm working through the fastai course, [Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2022](https://course.fast.ai), and learning to build iOS apps.

I'm also working through a math textbook, *Galois Theory* by David Cox. In general, I'm always learning some math, riding bikes, lifting weights, and playing some flamenco or classical guitar music.
